          Respiratory illnesses are a group of conditions that affect the lungs
          and airways, causing symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath,
          wheezing, and chest tightness. These illnesses can be caused by
          viruses, bacteria, or other irritants, and can range from mild to
          severe.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are many different types of respiratory illnesses that can
          affect the upper respiratory system (including the nose, sinuses, and
          throat) or the lower respiratory system (including the trachea,
          bronchi, and lungs).

            <p className="text-blue-primary text-lg text-center mt-8 mb-4">
              When you see a doctor about respiratory illness symptoms, they
              will start by getting a medical history and doing a physical exam.
              The doctor will check your lymph nodes, sinuses, throat, ears and
              listen to your lungs and heart.
              <br />
              <br />
              You will likely be given a swab test that will check for COVID,
              RSV, and the two common types of flu. These results may come back
              in just a few minutes, or you may be notified the next day.
              <br />
              <br />
              Depending on the exam results, the doctor may refer you to a
              specialist like an ear-nose-and-throat (ENT) doctor, or they may
              prescribe antibiotics or antiviral treatment.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have respiratory symptoms that arenâ€™t getting better, donâ€™t
              wait. Make an appointment to see a doctor to rule out something
              more serious â€” or get treatment if necessary.

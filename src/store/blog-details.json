        "content": "<p>Thanksgiving is a time of great food, fun with family and friends and counting blessings. Unfortunately, for some it is also a time when they have to spend hours in urgent care due to an injury.</p><p> In 2016, <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/why-thanksgiving-emergency-room-visits-spike-doctors-2017-11' > over 36,000 people </a> visited emergency rooms around the country on Thanksgiving day. Many of these injuries were related to cooking, including burns and cuts.</p><p> Kitchen safety for Thanksgiving involves simple precautions that help keep everyone safe. To avoid having your holiday ruined by a visit to urgent care, follow these simple tips!</p><h2> Most Common Kitchen Injuries and How to Prevent Them</h2><p> During Thanksgiving, there are more people in the kitchen than usual — nationwide and in individual kitchens. You might have four or five people cooking rather than the usual one or two. Too many cooks in the kitchen not only spoil the broth, it can also lead to more accidents – especially if you try new cooking techniques.</p><p> In addition, drinking causes impairment, leading to significant accidents while cooking. A big part of kitchen safety for Thanksgiving is ensuring anyone who has been drinking isn’t in the kitchen near hot food and appliances.</p><p> Here are other common Thanksgiving injuries to watch out for.</p><h3> Burns</h3><p> Burns are especially common on Thanksgiving. Some people try to fry a turkey for the first time and suffer grease burns, and there are more kitchen fires on Thanksgiving as well.</p><p> To avoid burns:</p><ul> <li> <p> Use turkey fryers correctly according to the directions — always outdoors, with a fully thawed turkey, and with a lot of attention </p></li><li> <p> Remember that unattended food in the kitchen can boil over or cause fires </p></li><li> <p> Use oven mitts when moving hot food </p></li><li> <p> Consider having fewer people in the kitchen </p></li><li> <p> Have a fire extinguisher handy </p></li></ul><h3> Knife Injuries</h3><p> There’s a lot of chopping on Thanksgiving, and that can lead to accidents with knives. A cut can be serious and require a trip to urgent care, so it pays to be careful.</p><p> To avoid knife accidents:</p><ul> <li> <p> Ensure that children are supervised if they are helping with chopping </p></li><li> <p> Keep knives sharp </p></li><li> <p> Slice away from your hands and fingers </p></li><li> <p> Keep a first aid kit handy with disinfectant and bandages </p></li></ul><h3> Food Poisoning</h3><p> Food poisoning can happen if food is left out for too long, but it’s also possible due to undercooked turkeys and other meat.</p><p> To avoid food poisoning:</p><ul> <li> <p> Make sure your turkey is fully thawed before Thanksgiving day </p></li><li> <p> Plan for plenty of cooking time, so you aren’t tempted to serve undercooked meat </p></li><li> <p> Put leftovers in the fridge right away </p></li></ul><p> When you follow these simple guidelines, you’ll be safer and less likely to need a visit to urgent care this Thanksgiving!</p><h2> Keeping Kids Safe While Cooking</h2><p> Thanksgiving is a great time to have younger family members help out in the kitchen, and there’s plenty of work to go around. However, it’s important to keep kids safe when they are helping out.</p><p> Part of kitchen safety for Thanksgiving is to keep folks out of the kitchen if they aren’t cooking, whether they are a child or adult. Unfortunately, the more people in the area, the higher the chance of accidents.</p><p> Next, ensure that children helping cook are shown the correct way to use kitchen tools. From a potato masher to a knife, a few minutes of instruction can help save you from an unfortunate accident. Help kids understand that helping in the kitchen is fun but that safety is paramount — pointing knives at others or flailing around is not appropriate.</p><p> Finally, have an adult supervising the children who are helping in the kitchen. Keeping an eye on kids can help them act responsibly, and you might be able to correct unsafe behavior before an accident happens.</p><h2> How to Know If You Should Visit the ER or Urgent Care</h2><p> If there is an accident and someone is injured, it’s important to get the right care right away. However, you might wonder if you should go to the emergency room or go to urgent care.</p><p> Urgent care clinics can do more for you than you might expect — and the cost is substantially lower as well. An urgent care can perform X-rays, MRIs, ultrasound, give stitches for cuts, casts for broken bones, and more.</p><p> However, a serious medical condition or injury will need emergency room care. These include life-threatening injuries and conditions, including heart attacks, severe or widespread burns, and cuts where you cannot stop the bleeding.</p><p> If you’re in a non-life-threatening situation, urgent care can generally give you the attention you need more quickly and at a lower cost than an emergency room.</p><h2> Practice Kitchen Safety This Thanksgiving</h2><p> Thanksgiving is a time of celebration and fun with family and friends. When you practice kitchen safety for Thanksgiving, you can avoid being interrupted by a trip to urgent care.</p><p> However, if someone is injured, it’s vital to get the care they need. Unless it’s life-threatening, your local urgent care clinic is a great choice for lower-cost, faster healthcare.</p><p> Have a great Thanksgiving!</p><br/><p> We hope you won’t need us, but if you do, we’re open on Thanksgiving at our mobile station.

        "subtitle": "Getting sick with the flu during the winter flu season can mean aches, pains and general discomfort. This coupled with missed school or work makes contracting the flu especially unpleasant.",
        "content": "<p>Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system, which includes your nose, throat and lungs. A standard case of the flu is enough to put you out for days. Severe cases can lead to hospitalizations and death.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the flu shot can reduce the likelihood of getting sick with the flu. Flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness between 40 and 60percent. While it’s still possible to get sick with the flu even after getting a flu shot, contrary to popular belief the flu shot does not cause the flu. Some people may feel ill or have a reaction after a dose of flu vaccine, but this reaction is not a case of the flu. Accessing the flu shot at Qcare, as well as at clinics and pharmacies located around New York City, makes getting the flu shot quick and easy. In this guide, we cover everything you need to know about getting a flu shot.</p><br/><h2>Common misconceptions about getting a flu shot</h2><p>Now is the time to decide whether or not you’ll get a flu shot this year. Let’s discuss some common misconceptions about the flu shot that could weigh into your decision.</p><br/><p><span className='font-bold'>The flu shot will make me get the flu.</span> The standard-dose influenza vaccine is made from an inactivated virus. The flu shot does not cause the flu.</p><br/><p>After getting a flu shot, you may experience side effects like headaches, low-grade fever or fatigue. The influenza vaccine protects you from experiencing severe symptoms of the flu virus itself.</p><br/><p>During flu season, other respiratory illnesses will be going around. Flu-like symptoms may be from an illness like the common cold.</p><br/><p><span className='font-bold'>I never get sick, so I don’t need a flu shot.</span> Even if you’re a healthy individual, you should get a flu shot to protect yourself and the loved ones around you.</p><br/><p><span className='font-bold'>There are other strains of the flu. This flu shot may not protect me from the right one.</span></p><p>Every year, scientists study trends to predict which strains of the flu will be the worst. The flu vaccine is designed to protect against two Influenza A viruses and two Influenza B viruses.</p><br/><p><span className='font-bold'>I can’t get the flu shot because I’m allergic to eggs.</span> The standard flu shot contains egg proteins. People with egg allergies can get the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_flublok-vaccine.htm'>Recombinant Influenza Vaccine</a>, which is an egg-free vaccine.</p><br/><h2>What is the flu?</h2><p>Flu season occurs during the fall and winter months. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) predicts an initial surge of flu cases in October. Flu season is expected to peak between December and February.</p><br/><p>The flu shares many symptoms with other respiratory viruses that go around during flu season. Because colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even impossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. A (laboratory-based influenza diagnostic test can tell if a person is sick with the flu. You can find out if you have the flu by getting a rapid flu test at a <a href='/locations'>testing center</a> near you.</p><br/><p>Here are some common symptoms of the flu:</p><br/><ul><li><p>Fever</p></li><li><p>Body aches</p></li><li><p>Cough</p></li><li><p>Sore throat</p></li><li><p>Runny or stuffy nose</p></li><li><p>Diarrhea (more common in children than adults)</p></li></ul><br/><p>This chart from the CDC is helpful to explain some of the key differences between a cold and the flu.</p><p><img src='/img/blog/flu-blog-content.png'/></p><h2>Who should get a flu shot?</h2><p>If you’re a generally healthy woman, you may be wondering if you need a flu shot this year. The CDC recommends everyone over 6 months old get a flu shot, with few exceptions.</p><br/><p>Even if you don’t usually get sick from respiratory bugs, you can spread the flu to <span className='font-bold'>high-risk</span> people if you’re not vaccinated.</p><br/><p>People at high risk of getting severely ill from the flu include:</p><br/><ul><li><p>Premature babies</p></li><li><p>Infants</p></li><li><p>Pregnant women</p></li><li><p>Adults older than 65</p></li><li><p>People with a chronic illness or weak immune system</p></li></ul><br/><p>High-risk individuals may have a difficult time fighting the flu. This can cause serious lung problems requiring hospitalizations for oxygen therapy or breathing machines.</p><br/><p>If you’re on the fence about whether or not to get a flu shot, consider the ages and health status of the people close to you.</p><br/><h3>Should pregnant women get a flu shot?</h3><p>Pregnant women are encouraged to get the flu shot to protect themselves and their babies.</p><br/><p>During pregnancy, your body experiences changes that affect your heart, lungs and immune system. This puts you at a higher risk of getting sick from the flu if you’re pregnant.</p><br/><p>Women who get a flu shot during pregnancy protect their babies well afterbirth. Since babies can’t get a flu shot until they’re 6 months old, newborns benefit from the immunity the vaccine provides.</p><br/><p>The flu shot is safe for pregnant women and people who are trying to conceive. You can get the flu shot <a href='https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/influenza/faq-20058522'>at any time during pregnancy</a>. However, women in their first or second trimester shouldn’t get vaccinated early in the summer months. The CDC recommends waiting until fall to get a flu shot so you are protected for the entire season.</p><br/><h3>Flu shots for adults over 65</h3><p>Older adults are at higher risk of getting sick from the flu because the immune system weakens as you age. In recent years, adults over 65 made up for:</p><br/><ul><li><p><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm'>50-70%</a> of flu-related hospitalizations</p></li><li><p><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm'>70-85%</a> of flu-related deaths</p></li></ul><br/><p>Adults above 65 may qualify for <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/qa_fluzone.htm'>higher-dose flu shots</a>. It’s safe to get a flu shot at the same time as other vaccines. Talk to your doctor about which vaccines you may need for your age.</p><br/><h3>The flu shot is important for people with chronic illness</h3><p>If you live with a chronic illness, you want to protect yourself from unnecessary illnesses and hospitalizations.</p><br/><p>People with certain chronic diseases and risk factors are at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from the flu. These <a href='https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/flu-risk-factors.html?cmp=KNC-DSO-COR-Health-ColdFlu-NonBrand-Exact-29256-GOOG-HEALTH-ConditionsTreatments-Health-RiskFactors-Exact-NonBrand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3d1m-W3Bw5GzS0P8Lb9XZNWkgeUndP3XG0ByFjAkI_3odLtwZS7JZgaAk8FEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds'>risk factors</a> include:</p><br/><ul><li><p>Diabetes</p></li><li><p>Heart disease</p></li><li><p>History of stroke</p></li><li><p>Lung disease</p></li><li><p>Asthma</p></li><li><p>Weak immune system</p></li><li><p>Obesity</p></li></ul><br/><p>If you have a chronic illness, talk to your doctor about getting a flu shot. There are very few exceptions for people who shouldn’t get the vaccine.</p><br/><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome or have ever had a severe reaction to the flu shot.</p><br/><h2>Summary</h2><p>The flu shot is a safe and effective way to protect yourself and others from the flu this season. Consider getting a flu shot if you have certain risk factors like advanced age, pregnancy or a chronic illness.</p><br/><p>Even if you’re generally healthy, consider getting vaccinated. When healthy people get the flu shot, you protect all the people around you. Visit a Qcare urgent care clinic to get a flu shot today.</p>"

        "content": "<p> RSV among children is <a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/rsv-and-other-respiratory-illnesses-spiking-in-children-across-tri-state/' > on the rise in New York </a> , and some medical centers have had to focus their resources on providing additional care. ER visits among children under age 5 have spiked to rates not seen since the Omicron wave last December. Doctors are concerned the nation could face a <a href='https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-facing-potential-tripledemic-flu-rsv-covid-19/story?id=91997909' > 'tripledemic' </a> this fall and winter as cases of flu, RSV and COVID-19 infections collide.</p><p> Most professionals think that the RSV spike is because people are no longer wearing masks and social distancing, which caused a dramatic drop in RSV over the past two years.</p><p> Worldwide, RSV <a href='https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv#:~:text=Globally%2C%20RSV%20affects%20an%20estimated,causes%20160%2C000%20deaths%20each%20year.' > affects 64 million people </a> and causes 160,000 deaths each year. Understanding the symptoms of this illness, how to treat it, and who is at risk for a severe illness is important as we head into cold and flu season.</p><h2>What is RSV?</h2><p> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus during cold season. It causes mild, cold-like symptoms in most people, but for some, it can be serious.</p><p> Those most at risk include seniors and infants. A serious case of RSV can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, even in babies under 1 year old.</p><p> The CDC <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html'> offers some sobering statistics </a> . Each year, RSV results in:</p><ul> <li><p>2.1 million doctor visits among children under age 5</p></li><li> <p>58,000 hospitalizations and 100-300 deaths among children under age 5</p></li><li> <p>177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among adults over age 65</p></li></ul><p> Understanding the symptoms can help you recognize and treat RSV quickly so that the illness doesn’t become more serious.</p><h2>Symptoms and treatment of RSV</h2><p> How do you know when someone has RSV? In many people, there are core symptoms to watch for. However, very young infants may not show these symptoms and may instead be irritable, have trouble breathing, and be less active.</p><p>Common symptoms include:</p><ul> <li> <p>Runny nose</p></li><li> <p>Coughing and sneezing</p></li><li> <p>Wheezing</p></li><li> <p>A fever</p></li><li> <p>Decreased appetite</p></li></ul><p> Most cases of RSV resolve on their own within one or two weeks. Because it’s a virus, there’s no specific treatment for the illness itself. However, if RSV leads to more serious conditions like bronchitis or pneumonia, seeing a doctor and getting additional medical help is vital.</p><h2>What to expect with RSV</h2><p> If you recognize symptoms of RSV, what can you expect as the illness progresses and resolves? We’ll answer some of the most commonly asked questions here.</p><p>How long does RSV last?</p><p> Most cases are mild and last between one and two weeks. If it becomes a serious issue like pneumonia, it may last longer and take longer to recover.</p><p>Is RSV contagious?</p><p> Yes, people who have RSV are usually contagious for <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/transmission.html#:~:text=People%20infected%20with%20RSV%20are,as%20long%20as%204%20weeks.' > between three and eight days </a> . Infants and those with weaker immune systems can continue to spread the virus for up to a month. Children often get exposed to RSV at school or activities and then transmit it to other members of the family.</p><p> RSV germs can last on hard surfaces for several hours and on soft surfaces for an hour or more.</p><p>Who is most at risk with RSV?</p><p> Almost everyone gets a form of RSV in their lifetime, and generally the illness passes without incident. However, those most at risk for severe illness or complications include:</p><ul> <li> <p> Infants and young kids, especially preemies, and those with compromised immune systems or those who have had heart or lung disease since birth </p></li><li> <p>Adults with compromised immune systems</p></li><li> <p> Adults who are older, especially if they also have heart or lung disease </p></li></ul><p>When should you call the doctor about RSV?</p><p>Since most cases of RSV are mild, seeing a doctor isn’t always necessary.</p><p> However, call or visit a doctor right away if you or a family member are at risk for severe RSV and have the following symptoms: high fever, difficulty breathing, blue color to the skin (check the lips and nails especially) or dehydration. Also, watch for symptoms that are getting worse or aren’t improving after a week.</p><p> If you’re concerned about your child, yourself, or a family member, visiting an urgent care center can help ensure everything is okay and let you know if further treatment is needed.</p><h2>Get the treatment you need for RSV</h2><p> Because it’s a virus, a doctor can manage symptoms and help a patient get the oxygen they need while they fight off the illness. There’s no direct treatment that attacks or kills a virus.</p><br/><p> In late October, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci announced that U.S. officials are working on a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine that could come within the next year or two.</p><br/><p> While RSV cases are typically mild, it still causes serious problems for millions of people a year. Don’t hesitate to visit Qcare if you’re concerned about symptoms in yourself or your family members.</p>"

        "subtitle": "Raising awareness this November about how to prevent and treat COPD",
        "content": "<p><p> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe. For decades, COPD was thought of as a man’s disease – but in recent years, the number of women with COPD is increasing. Today, more women die from COPD than men.</p><br/><p> World COPD Day is November 16, 2022. We’re raising awareness about COPD in women to help you save your lungs from a deadly disease.</p><br/><p> Find out how COPD affects women and what you can do to prevent it. You only get one set of lungs in your life – take the first step today to protect them.</p><h2> What Is COPD in Women?</h2><p> COPD is a condition that causes limited airflow in the lungs. It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p> In COPD, lung tissue becomes inflamed from long-term exposure to toxins. This makes it hard for air to move in and out of the lungs. It also makes it hard for the lungs to get rid of carbon dioxide. This is the gas that is released when you breathe out.</p><p> The main symptom of COPD is dyspnea, or difficulty breathing. Other <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/symptoms-diagnosis' > symptoms </a> include:</p><ul> <li> <p> Chronic cough </p></li><li> <p> Excessive mucus production </p></li><li> <p> Shortness of breath </p></li><li> <p> Getting tired easily </p></li><li> <p> Bluish lips or nail beds </p></li><li> <p> Frequent respiratory infections </p></li></ul><p> People with COPD struggle to live active lives. Everyday activities make you feel “winded” and easily tired. Many people with severe COPD can’t function normally – it’s the leading cause of disability and death in the U.S.</p><p> COPD is a chronic disease, meaning people learn to live with it. Although there is no cure, it’s a preventable and treatable illness. Here’s how you can prevent and manage COPD to live your most active life.</p><h2> How Does COPD Affect Women?</h2><p> The American Lung Association estimates more than <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd' > 125 million </a> people in the U.S. have COPD. It was originally most common among male smokers.</p><p> Because COPD was thought to be a man’s disease, women have been largely underdiagnosed. Their symptoms may have been overlooked or not screened for at all.</p><p> Now, the number of men diagnosed with COPD is decreasing – but for women, the number continues to rise.</p><p> Many women aren’t diagnosed with COPD because they don’t realize they have symptoms. To prevent severe lung disease, it’s important to be familiar with the symptoms and warning signs of COPD.</p><p>How does COPD impact women differently than men? A 2018 <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6171761/'>study</a> found that women with COPD have more burden from the disease than men.</p><p> In the study, women with COPD had more trouble breathing than men. They had more trouble moving air and more COPD flare-ups. Experts believe it’s because women’s lungs handle toxins differently than men's. Research showsthat female smokers are <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/copd/basics-about.html'>more likely</a> to get COPD at a young age than males.</p><h2> What Causes COPD?</h2><p> Smoking is the leading cause of COPD, but there are other risk factors women should be aware of. Here are the possible <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/what-causes-copd#:~:text=Approximately%2085%20to%2090%20percent,Exposure%20to%20air%20pollution' > causes </a> of COPD:</p><ul> <li> <p> Smoking. 85-90 percent of people diagnosed with COPD are cigarette smokers. </p></li><li> <p> Environmental toxins. Breathing in toxins over a long period of time increases your risk of lung disease. You may be exposed to toxins from air pollution, secondhand smoke, and chemicals (for example, in the workplace). </p></li><li> <p> Alpha-1 deficiency. A protein called alpha-1 protects the lungs. Some people with COPD are born with a genetic condition that causes a lack of alpha-1. </p></li></ul><h2> How Is COPD Diagnosed and Treated?</h2><p> If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms of COPD, talk to your doctor. Many women don’t realize symptoms like feeling winded can be a warning sign for COPD.</p><br/><p> Doctors diagnose COPD by reviewing your health history and running a series of tests. The purpose of testing is to look at how your lungs are functioning.</p><br/><p> In a test called <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-procedures-and-tests/spirometry' >spirometry</a>, your doctor will have you blow into a machine. The machine tells how easily and quickly you move air through your lungs. It can tell how big of a breath you take.</p><br/><p> Other <a href='https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685' > lab tests </a> to diagnose COPD include:</p><br/><ul> <li> <p> Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency test. Alpha-1 deficiency is one of the causes of COPD, especially in people diagnosed at a young age. Your doctor may recommend this test if you have a family history of COPD. </p></li><li> <p> Arterial blood gas. This test tells how much oxygen is in the blood that is pumping to your organs. The test measures gas exchange by checking for too much CO2. </p></li><li> <p> Chest X-ray. This picture gives your doctor a closer look at your lungs. </p></li></ul><br/><p> Treating COPD means managing a chronic condition. You may be prescribed medications to help you breathe or to reduce the number of flare-ups. Some people with COPD need to be on oxygen all the time.</p><br/><p> A lung specialist may recommend pulmonary rehab. This type of program helps people with COPD live a more active life. It gives people education, nutrition advice, and exercise training to manage COPD. <br/> <br/></p><h2> How to Reduce Your Risk of COPD</h2><p> The number one way to prevent COPD is to stop smoking – or if you're a nonsmoker, don’t start. Keep in mind, secondhand smoke is a leading cause of COPD. If you live with a smoker, encourage them to stop smoking or go outside to smoke.</p><p> You can prevent COPD by being aware of the toxins in your environment. Wear a mask If you work in a setting where you’re exposed to lots of chemicals.</p><p> Talk to your doctor if you’re at risk for developing COPD or have any of the symptoms. Knowing the warning signs of COPD can help you catch it early.</p><p> Your lungs are what keep you breathing – take care of them today by knowing the warning signs of COPD and getting screened.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><p> Sources</p><br/><ol> <li> <p> <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/symptoms-diagnosis' > What are COPD symptoms? </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd' > Learn about COPD </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6171761/'> Women manifest more severe COPD symptoms across the life course </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/copd/basics-about.html'> Basics about COPD </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/what-causes-copd#:~:text=Approximately%2085%20to%2090%20percent,Exposure%20to%20air%20pollution' > COPD causes and risk factors </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-procedures-and-tests/spirometry' > What Is Spirometry and Why It Is Done </a> </p></li><li> <p> <a href='https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685' > COPD- diagnosis and treatment </a> </p></li></ol><br/><br/><a href='https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd'> https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd</a>"

It’s better to be safe than sorry, but if you have a better understanding of headaches and the symptoms of a concussion, you’ll be able to make an informed decision.</p><p>Here’s how to recognize a concussion if you have one.</p><h2>Common Causes of Concussions</h2><p>A concussion happens when your head is jarred or impacted hard enough that the fluid surrounding your brain isn’t enough to cushion it, so the brain hits the inner walls of the skull. This can affect your brain function for at least a few days and sometimes longer.</p><p>Many people are aware that football players frequently suffer concussions from the hard hits of their sport. Many youth soccer leagues in recent years banned headbutting. However, head injuries can happen in everyday situations as well.</p><p>Generally, concussions occur due to a blow to the head or violent shaking of the head or upper body. This can happen:</p><p>● In a car accident</p><p>● In an accidental collision with another person while walking or running</p><p>● From a fall</p><p>● Hitting your head on a cabinet, door, or another object</p><p>● During sports such as soccer, football, and other contact sports</p><p>If you’ve had a recent concussion, an additional impact to the head is <a href='https://concussion.weillcornell.org/am-i-now-greater-risk-another-concussion#:~:text=Yes%2C%20there%20is%20an%20increased,recovery%20of%20the%20first%20concussion.'>more likely to cause another one</a>.</p><h2>Warning Signs of a Concussion</h2><p>How do you know if you’re suffering from a concussion or just have a normal headache?</p><p>First, it’s important to dispel the myth that you must lose consciousness to get a concussion. You may not lose consciousness at all and yet have serious symptoms that last days or weeks.</p><p>If you’ve hit your head or had your head or neck seriously jarred, you’re at risk for a concussion, especially if you now have a headache or pressure in your head that is acute or persistent.</p><p>Other symptoms of concussions include:</p><p>● Ringing in your ears</p><p>● Nausea or vomiting</p><p>● Loss of memory, especially of the event that caused the concussion</p><p>● Confusion, fatigue or a foggy feeling</p><p>● Blurry vision, dizziness or balance problems</p><p>● Problems with concentration or memory</p><p>● Irritability and personality changes</p><p>● Problems sleeping</p><p>● Sensitivity to light and noise</p><p>● Depression and psychological problems</p><p>● Taste and smell problems</p><p>Keep in mind that these symptoms may not start immediately after the injury. Symptoms can begin to appear several days afterward.</p><p>Even if you’re not experiencing any immediate symptoms, if you know you’ve had a head injury, it’s helpful to go to urgent care or the doctor for an exam. If you’re struggling with significant symptoms, go quickly to the Emergency Department.</p><h2>Concussions in Children</h2><p>The symptoms of a concussion in a young child or infant can be different, especially since they don’t express themselves in the same way.</p><p>If you notice the following signs of a concussion, it’s important to take your child to a doctor:</p><p>● Looking dazed</p><p>● Being listless or tiring quickly</p><p>● Unsteady walking and lack of balance</p><p>● Excessive crying, irritability, or crankiness</p><p>● Changes in eating or sleeping habits</p><p>● Losing interest in favorite activities or toys</p><p>● Vomiting</p><p>● Seizures</p><p>Even if your child isn’t exhibiting any symptoms right away, if you’re aware of a head injury, it’s important to take them to see the doctor or to urgent care. If they have significant symptoms, you’ll want to take them to the emergency department for immediate care.</p><h2>When to See a Doctor or Visit Urgent Care</h2><p>Very simply, if you or your child has had a head injury beyond a mild bump, it’s important to see a doctor or visit urgent care within a day or two.</p><p>If you or your child have severe symptoms such as severe headache, vomiting, seizures, or increasing confusion, visit the Emergency Room as quickly as possible.</p><p>Even if a concussion is minor it can impact how your brain functions and put you at risk for additional concussions if you hit your head again in the near future.</p><h2>Concussion Treatment and Length</h2><p>Do not take pain medication directly after a concussion, as that can worsen bleeding and mask symptoms. Treatment for a concussion generally involves physical and mental rest.</p><p>Gradually, you’ll ease back into your daily activities. Pay attention to how you feel and back off an activity when it worsens your symptoms.</p><p>Limit activities that trigger concussion symptoms, which may include:</p><p>● Looking at your smartphone screen</p><p>● Reading</p><p>● Watching television</p><p>● Playing video games</p><p>● Listening to loud music</p><p>● Physical activity</p><p>Over time, your symptoms will improve, and you can resume more and more of your usual daily routine. There’s no set recovery period for a concussion, so be sure to watch your symptoms carefully.</p><h2>Get the Care You Need for a Concussion</h2><p>Concussions can be very serious, so be sure to go to Qcare or see your doctor within a day or two of a head injury or impact. If you have serious symptoms, go to an Emergency Department for immediate help.</p><p>Worried about a concussion? We can help. Contact us to make an appointment today!</p><div><br/></div>"

        "CTA": "true",
        "content": "<p> ‘Tis the season for holiday cheer… and potlucks, and inexperienced cooks trying their hand at turkey, pudding, and more.</p><p> While we all love the food and festivity of the holidays, the fun stops when guests go home with food poisoning. Everyone means well, but not everyone knows how to cook food to the right temperature, store food properly, and other safety techniques. Food poisoning is more common during holiday seasons when hosts are preparing large quantities of food ahead and reheating it in time to serve.</p><p> It’s up to each of us to use proper methods for cooking and storing food and to watch for signs that food may not be safe. Here are some tips to help you avoid food poisoning.</p><h2>4 Ways to Prevent Food Poisoning</h2><p> The unfortunate truth is that both bacteria and viruses can spread through food, making us ill. The good news is that you can take steps to prevent food poisoning.</p><h3>Store Uncooked Food Separately</h3><p> Keeping raw meats separate from other food — and from each other — is an important way to stay healthy during the holidays.</p><p> You also want to keep meats and other foods separate in your shopping cart and use different cutting boards for meats and other foods to keep the meat juices from contaminating other items.</p><p> If you see that something has been tainted, throw it out to avoid food poisoning.</p><h3>Keep Your Hands and Work Surfaces Clean</h3><p> It’s not just meat juices that can carry germs around your kitchen. Your hands, counters, and utensils can as well.</p><p> Make sure you’re washing your hands thoroughly regularly and carefully wash all preparation surfaces as well.</p><p>Other important times to wash up include:</p><p>● Before you eat</p><p>● After touching pets or handling pet food or treats</p><p> ● After using the toilet, changing a diaper, or cleaning up a child who used the toilet</p><p> ● Before and after coughing, sneezing, treating a cut or wound, or caring for someone who is ill</p><h3>Cook Food to the Right Temperature</h3><p> If you don’t have a reliable food thermometer, that’s the first thing you should buy before you prepare food for yourself or others. A digital thermometer is inexpensive and can tell you when you’ve cooked food to a safe temperature.</p><p> What are the <a href='https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures' >safe temperatures</a> ?</p><p>● Beef: 145℉ and a three-minute rest</p><p>● Ground beef or pork: 160℉</p><p>● Poultry: 165℉</p><p>● Eggs: until yolk and white are firm, or 160℉ for casseroles</p><p>● Reheating precooked ham: 165℉</p><p>● Pork steaks, chops, or roasts: 145℉ and a three-minute rest</p><h3>Keep Food Out of the Temperature “Danger Zone”</h3><p> You want to avoid having food in the 40℉ to 140℉ “danger zone” that allows bacteria to multiply quickly.</p><p> Hot food should be put away between 30 minutes and two hours after cooking. Cold food should be refrigerated less than two hours after being served.</p><p> If you notice that food has been sitting out for long, be sure to say something to the host and encourage them to put it away. That way, everyone can avoid food poisoning!</p><h2>Is There Treatment For Food Poisoning Once it Starts?</h2><p> Call your doctor or urgent care if you’re sick with food poisoning. Your doctor will ask a lot of questions about where you’ve been and what you’ve eaten and also perform tests to determine what organism is causing it.</p><p> It could be any number of different types of bacteria or viruses, and the doctors also want to find out if there’s a particular source of the illness so others can be notified. If a specific organism or source of illness is found, the treatment will focus on eradicating it.</p><p> <a href='https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/food-poisoning/treatment' >Common treatments</a> for food poisoning include:</p><p>● Replacing lost fluids</p><p> ● Antibiotics, although these are not appropriate for all types of food poisoning</p><p>● Rest</p><p>● Easing back into eating</p><p> As you can see, there’s no slam-dunk treatment that makes your illness go away. That’s why it’s so important to take steps to avoid food poisoning.</p><h2>When to Visit Urgent Care For Food Poisoning</h2><p> While food poisoning often goes away on its own, there are times you will want to get medical treatment.</p><p> If you’re experiencing symptoms of dehydration like dry mouth, extreme thirst, dark concentrated urine, rapid heartbeat or low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or confusion, come to Qcare urgent care right away. We can help you get the fluids you need to continue your recovery.</p><p>You’ll also want to see a doctor if:</p><p>● You’ve been very sick for more than 48 hours</p><p>● There’s blood in your vomit or poop</p><p>● Extreme cramps</p><p>● Fever of 102℉ or more</p><p>● Blurry vision, tingling in your arms, or muscle weakness</p><p> Certain people are more at risk from food poisoning, including those 60 and older, babies and children, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system. Those people should see a doctor at the first sign of this illness.</p><p> Do you need to schedule an appointment with Qcare urgent care? We’re here for you.

        "content": "<p>Signs and Symptoms of Pneumonia and When to Seek Care</p><p> With RSV, COVID-19 and the flu expected to all affect New Yorkers this winter, it’s important to understand when and how these can turn into a case of pneumonia. According to the CDC, in 2018 <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/dotw/pneumonia/index.html' >1.5 million Americans</a > were diagnosed with pneumonia, and 40,000 died from the disease.</p><p> What are the signs of pneumonia, and can you treat pneumonia at urgent care? The answers to these questions will help you get the care you need to fight off pneumonia successfully.</p><h2>What Causes Pneumonia?</h2><p>Pneumonia can be caused by a virus, bacteria, or even fungi.</p><p> Bacterial pneumonia is most commonly caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and can impact a small area of your lungs or all of both lungs.</p><p> A virus causes about one-third of all pneumonia cases, which can include a variety of viruses, such as the flu. Generally, viral pneumonia is not as serious as bacterial pneumonia and will heal more quickly.</p><p> Fungi from dirt or bird droppings can cause pneumonia if there is heavy exposure.</p><h3>Common Types of Pneumonia</h3><p> There are over 30 types of pneumonia, and they are categorized by cause. That means the most common types of pneumonia are bacterial and viral pneumonia.</p><p> The treatment you receive will depend on the type of pneumonia you’re diagnosed with.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms of Pneumonia</h2><p> Pneumonia is an infection that causes the air sacs in one or both lungs to fill with fluid and become inflamed. You may experience coughing with phlegm, fever, chills, and trouble breathing.</p><p>The most common symptoms include:</p><p>● A cough with yellow, green, or bloody mucus</p><p>● Bluish color to lips and fingernails</p><p>● Heavy sweating</p><p>● Fever</p><p>● Trouble breathing or breathing rapidly</p><p>● Extreme fatigue</p><p>● Sharp or stabbing pain when breathing or coughing</p><h3>When to go to Urgent Care for Pneumonia</h3><p> When should you see a doctor for pneumonia? Can you treat pneumonia at urgent care, or do you need to see your regular doctor?</p><p> If you experience symptoms including chest pain, trouble breathing, a persistent fever over 102, or a cough that doesn’t go away, you should see a doctor. Fortunately, professionals can treat pneumonia at an urgent care center, so you don’t have to wait to see your regular doctor.</p><p> It’s also important to see a doctor quickly if you’re at a higher risk of complications or serious illness, which includes infants and children under2, adults over age 65, smokers, and those with chronic medical conditions such as lung and heart issues.</p><h3>What to Expect When Your Child Gets Pneumonia</h3><p> Seeing your child sick is hard for parents, and you want to get them the best care you can. As with adults, <a href='https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions---pediatrics/p/pneumonia-in-children.html' >childhood pneumonia</a > can be mild or severe. It’s most common in kids under the age of five.</p><p> Children may experience coughing, pain while coughing, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite and vomiting or diarrhea when they have pneumonia. If the cause is a virus, symptoms may develop more slowly.</p><p> You’ll want to take your child to the doctor to make sure you get an accurate diagnosis since some of these symptoms occur with other illnesses as well.</p><h2>How to Prevent and Treat Pneumonia</h2><p> To prevent pneumonia, you want to limit your exposure to the bacteria and viruses that cause it. That means getting your annual flu shot, talking to your doctor about getting specific pneumonia vaccines and practicing good cleanliness.</p><p> It’s also important to keep your immune system strong by eating healthy food, exercising, and getting the sleep you need. Finally, avoid smoking, as it compromises your lungs and makes you susceptible to illness.</p><p> If you do get pneumonia, it will be treated based on the cause. For bacterial pneumonia, the doctor will give you antibiotics. For viral pneumonia, there’s no specific treatment other than resting, getting lots of fluids, and using over-the-counter medication to control coughing and pain until the pneumonia heals on its own.</p><p> In some cases, pneumonia can cause serious lung infections and breathing problems. In those cases, you may need to be hospitalized and monitored until the illness clears. You might need breathing assistance, temperature control, and more.</p><p> Children may be hospitalized if they are under two months old, are excessively tired, appear dehydrated, or have trouble breathing or low oxygen levels. Medical assistance can help them stay stable until the illness goes away.</p><h2>Get the Care You Need For Pneumonia</h2><p> If you are worried that you might have pneumonia, it’s important to seek care and treatment. Fortunately, doctors can treat pneumonia at urgent care, so you can make an appointment and be seen right away.</p><p>If you need to make an appointment, we’re here to help. Contact us today!</p>"

Faced with a triple threat of respiratory viruses, NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan says the city's health office is recommending masks, vaccinations and boosters.</p><br/><p> The new mask advisory is an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19, flu and RSV. The advisory strongly urges that all individuals over the age of two should wear a face covering when in any indoor public space or outdoor public space where social distancing is not possible.</p><br/><blockquote class='twitter-tweet'> <p lang='en'> Today <a href='https://twitter.com/NYCHealthCommr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw' >@NYCHealthCommr</a > issued an advisory as NYC faces high levels of COVID-19, flu and RSV.

Flu, RSV and COVID-19 cases are up, including an increase in hospitalizations. Cases for RSV, which spiked this fall, may have already peaked. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky says hospitalizations from cases of the flu are the highest the agency has seen at this time of year in a decade.</p><br/><p> <img src='/img/blog/mask-blog-content.png' width='624' height='267'/></p><p> Source: <a href='https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=New+York&amp;data-type=CommunityLevels&amp;null=CommunityLevels' > CDC Data Tracker </a></p><br/><br/><h1>RSV vs. flu vs. COVID-19</h1><br/><p> Symptoms from RSV, flu and COVID-19 can be similar. The best way to know your diagnosis is to get tested at a clinic, like Qcare. Following are some differences between the three viruses.</p><br/><p> RSV: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a virus that is common in infants and young children and is one of the most common causes of lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.</p><br/><p> Symptoms of RSV are similar to a cold and include fever, runny nose, cough and difficulty breathing. Cases are typically mild, but RSV can result in hospitalization.</p><br/><p> When cases of the virus spike in general, as it did in late October and early November, severe cases spike as well. Infants and seniors are at a higher risk of hospitalization from RSV.</p><br/><p> Flu: The flu, or Influenza, is a contagious respiratory virus caused by the influenza virus. Symptoms of the flu include fever, chills, body aches, sore throat, runny nose, coughing, and fatigue.</p><br/><p>The flu can be serious and can even lead to death.</p><br/><p> COVID-19: COVID-19 is a virus caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, including fever, cough, cold symptoms, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, fatigue and body aches.</p><br/><p> In severe cases, COVID-19 can cause difficulty breathing or severe symptoms. Go to the emergency room if you are experiencing difficulty breathing.</p><br/><h2>One test panel covers flu, RSV or COVID-19</h2><br/><p> At Qcare mobile urgent care stations, located throughout New York City, we offer four tests with just one swab: COVID PCR, flu A &amp; B and RSV. There is no out-of-pocket cost for symptomatic patients.</p><br/><p> Similarly to COVID-19 testing, testing for the flu, RSV and COVID-19 panel is done with a nasal swab.</p><br/><br/><h3>When to go to urgent care for flu, RSV or COVID-19</h3><br/><p> When it comes to deciding whether to go to urgent care for the flu, RSV, or COVID-19, it’s important to consider your symptoms and the severity of your condition.</p><br/><p> If you have any of the following symptoms, you should seek medical attention at an urgent care center for flu, RSV or COVID-19:</p><p>• High fever (over 100.4°F)</p><p>• Difficulty breathing</p><p>• Chest pain</p><p>• Severe muscle or body aches</p><p>• Severe or persistent vomiting</p><p>• Dizziness or confusion</p><p>• Severe fatigue</p><p>• Loss of appetite</p><p>• Severe abdominal pain</p><br/><p> If you have any of the above symptoms and are not sure whether you should seek treatment, it’s best to err on the side of caution and go to an urgent care center, like Qcare.</p><br/><p> It is also important to remember that you should not go to the emergency room unless you are having an emergency. In addition to the above symptoms, it is also important to consider the severity of your condition.</p><h2>What masks offer the best protection?</h2><p> Wearing a mask in indoor spaces helps protect you and your loved ones, while preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. Some masks are more effective than others.</p><br/><p> 1. Cloth Face Masks: Cloth face masks are one of the most popular and affordable options for COVID-19 protection. They are effective at trapping droplets from coughs and sneezes and can be washed and reused.</p><br/><p> 2. N95 Masks: N95 masks are the most effective for protecting against COVID-19. These masks are designed to filter out 95 percent of airborne particles and are especially effective against the coronavirus.</p><br/><p> 3. KN95 Masks: KN95 masks are similar to N95 masks, but are made to meet Chinese standards. They are also effective against COVID-19, and are considered to be slightly less effective than N95 masks. This is because an N95 respirator has straps that go around the head to ensure a tight seal, while a KN95 respirator has ear loops.</p><br/><br/><p> 4. Surgical Masks: Surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets and other large particles and are often used in medical settings. They are not as effective as N95 or KN95 masks, but they can still provide some protection against Covid-19.</p><br/><p> 5. Face Shields: Face shields provide full face protection and help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by blocking droplets from entering the eyes, nose, and mouth. They are not as effective as masks, but they can provide additional protection</p><br/><h2>How to safely wear a mask</h2><br/><p> It’s important to remember the proper way to wear a mask for the most effectiveness.</p><br/><p>1. Wash your hands before putting on a mask.</p><br/><p>2. Make sure the mask fits snugly and covers your nose and mouth.</p><br/><p>3. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it.</p><br/><p>4. Make sure to replace the mask if it becomes damp or soiled.</p><br/><p> 5. When taking off the mask, do not touch the front of the mask. Instead, remove it from the straps or ties.</p><br/><p>6. After taking off the mask, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.</p><br/><h2>5 ways to get kids to wear a mask</h2><br/><p> 1. Make sure to explain to your children why masks are important for their health and for the health of those around them.</p><br/><p> 2. Show your children examples of other people wearing masks, such as family members, friends, or characters from TV shows or movies.</p><br/><p> 3. Find fun masks that your kids can wear. Many stores now have masks with fun designs or even masks featuring their favorite characters.</p><br/><p> 4. Create a reward system for your kids. Offer to give them a small reward or a sticker chart for each time they wear a mask.</p><br/><p> 5. Make sure to set a good example by wearing a mask yourself. Kids are more likely to follow your example than your words.</p><br/><br/><p> For fast, accurate testing for COVID-19, flu or RSV, visit a Qcare mobile station near you. You can make an appointment ahead of time or simply walk in.</p>"

The reason this is a great starting point is that your primary doctor already knows your history, what treatments have been tried, and other important details about your needs.</p><p> Instead of having to explain everything from the beginning, or get a full round of tests, you can skip to exactly what’s going on right now. Having a strong relationship with your PCP can also help you get the referrals you need to specialists and can make getting coverage through your health insurance easier.</p><p> When you can take care of your health by visiting your PCP, you’ll pay less out-of-pocket and have a knowledgeable partner guiding your health journey.</p><div className='text-center py-8'><a href='/locations' className='btn-primary text-blue-primary border-blue-primary border-2 uppercase hover:bg-blue-logo-secondary hover:border-blue-logo-secondary hover:text-white'> Book an Appointment</a></div><h2>When to Visit Urgent Care</h2><p> When you have symptoms that need immediate care or your PCP doesn’t have any opening, visit Qcare urgent care. You can make an appointment at a mobile station near you or walk right in. If these symptoms are not life-threatening, you’ll save time and money by going to an urgent care instead of the emergency room.</p><p> Urgent care centers are open seven days a week, and many are open late into the evening. You’ll pay <a href='https://www.debt.org/medical/emergency-room-urgent-care-costs/'> an average of $100-$150 </a> rather than the $1,000 or more it costs to go to an emergency room.</p><p> On top of that, you can simply walk into an urgent care clinic — while you can schedule an appointment for faster service, it’s not required.</p><p>Urgent care centers can manage a lot of health conditions, including:</p><p>● Illnesses</p><p>● Burns, cuts and scratches</p><p>● Sprains, strains and broken bones</p><p>● Asthma and allergic reactions</p><p>● Falls</p><p>● Animal and bug bites</p><p>● Headaches</p><p> They also have tools for blood tests, x-rays, pregnancy tests, drug tests, testing for STDs and more. You can even get vaccinations, flu shots, gynecological exams and physicals at an urgent care center.</p><p> Now that you know when to visit urgent care, let’s look at the only time you should go to the emergency room — when you have a life-threatening condition.</p><h2>When to Go to the Emergency Room</h2><p> Studies show that up to <a href='https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-07-22/avoidable-er-visits-fuel-us-health-care-costs' > </a> <a href='https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/2019/UHG-Avoidable-ED-Visits.pdf' > 66 percent of visits to the emergency department </a> could be handled elsewhere and that the cost to visit the emergency room is 12 times higher than visiting your regular doctor and 10 times higher than visiting urgent care.</p><p> Why pay so much more when you can get the same care for far less money at your doctor's office or urgent care?</p><p> In addition, when people use the emergency department for non emergencies, it inhibits the staff’s ability to effectively treat those with life-threatening conditions. That’s why it’s important to get your healthcare at the right clinic based on your needs.</p><p> When should you go to the emergency room? Only when you have a life-threatening emergency, such as:</p><br/><p>● Choking, difficulty breathing or stopped breathing</p><p>● Suffering from a head injury, especially with fainting or confusion</p><p> ● Suffering from a neck or spine injury, especially if there’s loss of feeling</p><p>● Electric shock or being hit by lightning</p><p>● Severe burns</p><p>● Chest pain or pressure</p><p>● Seizures</p><p>● A sudden, unusually bad headache</p><p>● Sudden weakness or drooping on one side of the body</p><p>● Heavy bleeding</p><p>● A broken bone protruding through the skin</p><p>● Poisoning or overdose from drugs or alcohol</p><br/><p> The emergency room is there to save lives and provide critical care that simply cannot wait for another medical provider.</p><h2>Choose Your Medical Provider Wisely</h2><p> You now know when to visit urgent care, a doctor or the emergency room. If you don’t have a life-threatening situation, avoid the emergency room so the staff there can focus on caring for those who do. Instead, work on getting an appointment with your primary doctor or going to an urgent care clinic.</p><p> An urgent care clinic can do many of the things we usually think of going to the emergency room for, including setting broken bones, testing for serious illness, and prescribing medication.</p><p> Save yourself a significant amount of time and money — make urgent care your default if your PCP is not available.</p>"

        "content": "<p> We’ve all felt it — that rumbling in your stomach that makes you nervous that you might throw up. Nausea is a common symptom of several conditions, from pregnancy to the flu.</p><p> Although nausea is common, there are times when it’s important to see a doctor. It can be a symptom of a more serious illness. It can also lead to dehydration and other concerns.</p><p> What are the common causes of nausea and vomiting, and when should you take action? Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2>What Causes Nausea and Vomiting?</h2><p> There are several health conditions that can cause nausea and vomiting. Common causes of nausea include the following:</p><br/><p>● Food allergies or food poisoning</p><p>● Infections of the stomach, such as the “stomach flu”</p><p>● Pregnancy</p><p>● Motion sickness</p><p>● Concussion or migraines</p><p>● Emotional stress or fear</p><p>● Overeating</p><p>● Heart attack</p><p>● Some forms of cancer</p><p>● Bowel obstruction</p><p>● Ulcers</p><p> As you can see, the causes of nausea range from temporary and mild to serious, long-term illnesses. That’s why it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical care when you need it.</p><h2>When Should I Be Concerned About Nausea and Vomiting?</h2><p>There are times when nausea and vomiting need medical care.</p><p> One of the most common is if you’re getting dehydrated. This is especially important in young children, who may not realize they’re dehydrated or be able to tell caregivers how they feel. Signs of dehydration include dry lips and mouth, sunken eyes and rapid breathing.</p><p>Other times to seek medical care include:</p><p>● Nausea or vomiting lasting more than a few days</p><p>● If a head injury has caused the illness</p><p>● If you see blood in the vomit</p><p>● If the ill person is lethargic or confused</p><p>● If there is severe abdominal pain</p><p> These additional symptoms mean that nausea could be a sign of something more serious.</p><h2>Why am I Nauseous But Not Vomiting?</h2><p> Not everyone who feels sick will actually vomit. For example, many people who struggle with motion sickness feel very nauseous but don’t always throw up. Stress, anxiety, headaches, and other ailments are other common causes of nausea without vomiting.</p><h2>How to Relieve and Prevent Nausea</h2><p> To relieve nausea quickly, drink ice-cold or clear drinks slowly. If you need to eat, choose bland, light foods such as crackers or toast. Avoid activity directly after eating, and get plenty of rest.</p><p> To prevent nausea, avoid things that you know are triggers for you feeling ill. You might take motion-sickness medication if you have to travel, or avoid flickering lights and strong odors. If food causes problems for you, make changes to your diet to avoid foods that make you feel ill. Spicy, high-fat, and greasy foods are often culprits.</p><p> You can also focus on eating food less likely to cause nausea, such as cereal, crackers, toast, and other mild foods.</p><h2>When to See a Doctor or Urgent Care</h2><p> If you notice symptoms that are a sign of something serious, such as the ones listed as concerns above, it’s important to see a doctor or go to urgent care.</p><p> An urgent care clinic can often get you in very quickly so you don’t have to wait several days until your doctor is available. Most causes of nausea and vomiting can be managed by urgent care.</p><p> If you suspect a life-threatening cause of illness, such as a heart attack or brain injury, you’ll want to call 911 or go to the emergency room right away.</p><h2>How to Treat Nausea</h2><p> If you’re feeling nauseous, you’ll want to take it easy and rest as much as possible. Drink very cold clear drinks, especially water. Gatorade can also be helpful to prevent dehydration.</p><p> Start with eating or drinking very small amounts and work your way up as you feel better.</p><p> If your nausea has a specific cause, such as a headache, medications that treat the cause can help with nausea as well. Pain medication, stomach-acid reducers or motion sickness medication can all make a difference.</p><h2>Take Care of Nausea With a Quick Care Visit Today</h2><p> Often, nausea and vomiting last only a day or two and you’re feeling better.
